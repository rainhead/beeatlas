# Washington Bee Atlas

## What This Is

An interactive web map displaying Ecdysis specimen records and iNaturalist collection events for volunteer collectors participating in the Washington Bee Atlas. The site is a static frontend (TypeScript, OpenLayers, Lit, hyparquet) that reads Parquet data bundled with the build — no server required at runtime. Three pipelines produce the Parquet: a Python pipeline fetching DarwinCore exports from Ecdysis (specimens), a pyinaturalist pipeline fetching collection events from iNat project 166376 (samples), and a scraping pipeline fetching Ecdysis specimen HTML pages to extract iNaturalist observation IDs (links). Infrastructure is CDK on AWS (S3 + CloudFront), deployed automatically via GitHub Actions OIDC.

## Core Value

Collectors can see where bees have been collected and where target host plants grow, enabling informed planning of future collecting events.

## Requirements

## Current Milestone: v1.5 Geographic Regions

**Goal:** Collectors can filter specimens and samples by geographic region (WA county or EPA Level III ecoregion) using a sidebar autocomplete or by clicking region boundaries on the map.

**Target features:**
- Pipeline spatial join: each specimen and sample gets `county` and `ecoregion_l3` columns at build time
- WA county and EPA Level III ecoregion GeoJSON bundled with the build
- Exclusive 3-state region boundary toggle on map: off / counties / ecoregions
- Region filter in sidebar: county multi-select + ecoregion multi-select (autocomplete)
- Clicking a visible region polygon adds it to the active filter
- Region filter ANDs with existing taxon/date filters; applies to both specimens and samples
- Map position unchanged when region is selected

### Active (v1.5)

(Requirements to be defined — see REQUIREMENTS.md)

### Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Tribe-level filtering | Tribe not present in Ecdysis DarwinCore export |
| Server-side API or backend | Static hosting constraint — all data client-side |
| User accounts / saved filters | URL sharing covers the use case |
| Multi-source data (GBIF, OSU Museum) | Experimental; Ecdysis is the specimen source of truth |
| Real-time data refresh | Static Parquet updated per pipeline run is correct |
| Heat map / analytics | Map is the analytical surface; charts are scope creep |
| iNaturalist host plant display layer | v1.2 uses iNat data for collection event samples, not a visual plant layer |
| Location search / pan-to-place | Deferred to v2 (NAV-02) |
| OR project (id=18521) | Out of scope; stub exists in projects.py |

## Context

Shipped v1.0 on 2026-02-22 (~6,172 lines across 47 files, 4 days). Shipped v1.1 on 2026-03-10 — URL sharing (+324 lines in `bee-map.ts` and `bee-sidebar.ts`). Shipped v1.2 on 2026-03-11 — iNat pipeline (+5,069/−1,005 lines across 56 files, 2 days): 244 Python + 51 shell scripts; samples.parquet produced and cached in S3. Shipped v1.3 on 2026-03-12 — links pipeline (+1,405/−31 lines across 18 files, single day): links.parquet with two-level cache skip, Ecdysis HTML scraping, S3 persistence.

**Tech stack:**
- Frontend: TypeScript, Vite, OpenLayers, Lit (LitElement), hyparquet, temporal-polyfill
- Pipeline: Python 3.14+, uv, pandas, pyarrow, pyinaturalist; geopandas (Ecdysis pipeline)
- Infrastructure: AWS CDK v2 (TypeScript), S3 + CloudFront OAC, OIDC IAM role
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (build on all pushes, deploy on push to main)

**Live site:** https://d1o1go591lqnqi.cloudfront.net

**Known tech debt:**
- CI build runs `npm run build` which calls `build-data.sh` — makes a live HTTP POST to ecdysis.org and live iNat API calls on every push. If either is down, CI fails. `frontend/src/assets/ecdysis.parquet` is committed as fallback; no fallback for samples.parquet yet.
- `speicmenLayer` typo in `bee-map.ts` (consistent, functions correctly).
- No VERIFICATION.md files for any phase — verification relies on human-approved SUMMARY files.
- Phase 1 SUMMARY references `--db` flag; actual CLI flag is `--datasetid`.
- Match iNat ofvs by field_id=8338 (not name) — field was renamed circa 2024; name matching drops ~40% of historical data.
- observations.ndjson cache stores full observation JSON with download timestamp (added in quick task post-v1.2).

## Constraints

- **Static hosting**: No server runtime — all data must be in static Parquet files bundled with or fetched by the frontend
- **Python version**: 3.14+ (per `data/pyproject.toml`)
- **Node.js**: Version pinned in `package.json`
- **AWS**: Infrastructure via CDK in `infra/`; deploy via OIDC role (not long-lived access keys)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Parquet as frontend data format | Enables browser-side filtering without a server; hyparquet reads client-side | ✓ Good — hyparquet read 45,754 rows cleanly; sub-second load |
| CDK for AWS infrastructure | User preference; keeps infra as code alongside the project | ✓ Good — BeeAtlasStack + GlobalStack deployed; OAC pattern stable in CDK v2.156+ |
| OIDC for GitHub Actions AWS auth | No long-lived secrets; matches reference project pattern | ✓ Good — StringLike trust policy (`repo:rainhead/beeatlas:*`) confirmed; no thumbprints needed |
| iNaturalist data in separate samples.parquet | Keep data sources separate; iNat and Ecdysis have different latencies and schemas | ✓ Good — v1.2 shipped; samples.parquet produced with correct schema and S3 caching |
| FilterState as singleton (not Lit reactive) | OL style callbacks have fixed signatures; can't receive extra params | ✓ Good — singleton mutation + `clusterSource.changed()` repaint pattern works cleanly |
| Style cache key = `count:tier` | Avoids per-render Style object allocation | ✓ Good — cache bypassed only when filter active; correct for all cases |
| Month DarwinCore 1-indexing | DarwinCore months are 1=January; the original +1 offset was a bug | ✓ Good — removed in Phase 5; all 12 months now reachable |
| `id-token: write` permission at job level | Workflow-level permission with multiple jobs causes credential load error | ✓ Good — deploy job-level permission works correctly |
| `S3BucketOrigin.withOriginAccessControl()` (OAC not OAI) | OAI is deprecated in CDK; OAC is the recommended pattern | ✓ Good — confirmed stable, no `websiteIndexDocument` on bucket needed |
| Deploy job rebuilds frontend independently | Avoids artifact upload/download complexity | ✓ Good — self-contained deploy job; acceptable double-build tradeoff |
| Query string (not hash) for URL state | Shareable, bookmarkable, works with browser history API natively | ✓ Good — x/y/z/taxon/yr0/yr1/months/o params encode full view state |
| replaceState on every moveend + debounced pushState (500ms) | Avoids history explosion while preserving back-button nav at settled positions | ✓ Good — back navigation works correctly between settled views |
| `_isRestoringFromHistory` guard + `map.once('moveend')` reset | Prevents popstate→moveend feedback loop; async reset required because OL fires moveend after DOM repaint | ✓ Good — required gap closure to fix (initially reset synchronously) |
| `_selectedOccIds: string[]` comma-separated in `o=` | Multi-occurrence cluster clicks encode all IDs; restore shows full cluster in sidebar | ✓ Good — three bugs required gap closure (preserve on load, all IDs, restore array) |
| Lit `updated()` pattern for URL-pushed restore props | BeeMap pushes restore props as `@property`; BeeSidebar mirrors to `@state` via `updated()` | ✓ Good — clean separation between map-driven restore and sidebar-driven state |
| Match iNat ofvs by field_id not name | Field renamed 'Number of bees collected' → 'numberOfSpecimens' circa 2024; name matching drops ~40% of historical data | ✓ Good — field_id=8338 is stable; confirmed from live API |
| Parse raw API dicts not pyinaturalist model objects | Model attribute access inconsistent for ofvs; raw dict access is explicit and debuggable | ✓ Good — required discovery in Phase 9 (initial model approach failed) |
| Use iNat API v1 (pyinaturalist default), not v2 | v2 has project observation count discrepancies; coordinate order also differs | ✓ Good — v1 returned correct counts and lat/lon order |
| Incremental fetch fallback on any exception | Any parse or merge error should trigger full re-fetch rather than producing corrupt parquet | ✓ Good — robust for corrupted cache states |
| Job-level env: S3_BUCKET_NAME in CI | Cleaner than per-step env; avoids repetition across three cache/build steps | ✓ Good — applied to both build and deploy jobs |
| Mirror cache-restore/build/cache-upload in both CI jobs | Keeps deploy job consistent with build job; both produce fresh samples.parquet | ✓ Good — credential ordering bug fixed in deploy job (credentials must precede build) |
| Use integer `ecdysis_id` (not UUID `occurrenceID`) as `occid` URL parameter | Ecdysis individual record pages use integer DB id, not UUID; UUID in URL 404s or returns page without association section | ✓ Good — identified prototype bug; corrected in Phase 11 |
| Add `occurrenceID` to `ecdysis.parquet` rather than maintaining separate `ecdysis_wa.parquet` | Simpler to extend existing pipeline output than maintain a second file | ✓ Good — single source of truth; Phase 11 reads from `ecdysis.parquet` |
| Two-level cache skip (links.parquet then disk HTML) | Avoids re-fetching pages already linked or already cached; links are permanent | ✓ Good — both levels implemented and tested; rate limit applies only to HTTP requests, not cache hits |
| Initialize `last_fetch_time = time.monotonic()` not `0.0` | Ensures first HTTP request also respects rate limit | ✓ Good — caught by TDD test; ensures ≤20 req/sec from first request |
| S3 sync for HTML cache, S3 cp for links.parquet | HTML cache is a directory of many small files (sync efficient); links.parquet is a single file (cp simpler) | ✓ Good — mirrors iNat pipeline pattern |
| Restore with graceful miss (`\|\| echo`), upload with fail-fast (`set -euo pipefail`) | First CI run has no cache to restore; upload failure means corrupt state | ✓ Good — correct asymmetry; matches v1.2 cache pattern |
