<objective>
Human verification of MAP-01 and MAP-02: confirm clustering, click behavior, sidebar, and layout work correctly in the browser.

Purpose: Gate phase completion on visual and interactive confirmation that the core map feature is usable.
Output: User confirmation that Phase 3 is complete, or a description of issues to fix.

  <name>Human verify: MAP-01 clustering and MAP-02 click-to-detail sidebar</name>
  <action>Run `cd /Users/rainhead/dev/beeatlas/frontend && npm run dev` and open http://localhost:5173. Follow the verification sequence in how-to-verify below.</action>
  <done>User types "approved" — all clustering, click-to-detail, sidebar, and layout behaviors confirmed.</done>
  <what-built>
    - Plan 01: Parquet column expansion, Cluster source wiring, recency-aware clusterStyle

  <how-to-verify>
    Run: `cd /Users/rainhead/dev/beeatlas/frontend && npm run dev`
    Open: http://localhost:5173

    Test sequence:
    1. MAP-01 — Clustering:
       - At default zoom, specimen points should appear as colored numbered circles (not individual dots)
       - Colors: green = recent (within 6 weeks), orange = this year, grey = before this year
       - Zoom in — clusters should split into smaller clusters and individual points
       - Every cluster should display a count number inside it

    2. MAP-02 — Click to sidebar:
       - Click a cluster — sidebar should switch from summary stats to a sample list
       - Each entry should show: date (e.g. "June 2023"), collector name, fieldNumber, then species list below
       - Multiple samples should appear most-recent-first
       - Click empty map area — sidebar should return to summary statistics
       - Click "Back" button inside panel — sidebar should return to summary statistics

    3. Summary statistics (default sidebar state):
       - Total specimens, species count, genus count, family count, year range should all be populated
       - Should appear before clicking anything

    4. Layout:
       - Desktop (landscape): sidebar is a fixed right panel (~25rem wide) with a left border
       - Mobile (portrait, or resize browser to narrow tall): map is top ~50%, sidebar fills bottom half

    If any item above does not match: describe exactly what you see and what is wrong.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all checks pass, or describe specific issues to fix</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
User confirms all MAP-01 and MAP-02 behaviors work correctly in the browser.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Phase 3 complete when user types "approved" — all clustering, click-to-detail, sidebar default state, and layout behaviors confirmed.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After user approval, create `.planning/phases/03-core-map/03-03-SUMMARY.md` capturing:
- User approval status
- Any issues found and how they were resolved
- Phase 3 completion date

Then update STATE.md: Phase 3 complete, Current focus moves to Phase 4.
