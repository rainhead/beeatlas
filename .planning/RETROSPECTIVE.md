## Milestone: v1.1 — URL Sharing

**Shipped:** 2026-03-10
**Phases:** 1 (Phase 7) | **Plans:** 5 | **Sessions:** 2

### What Was Built
- URL state synchronization for map view (center/zoom) and all active filters (taxon, year range, months) encoded as query string params
- Shareable URLs: copying the browser URL and opening in a new tab restores the exact same map position and filter state
- Browser back/forward navigation between settled map views (500ms debounce before pushState)
- Multi-occurrence cluster URL encoding: `o=ecdysis:id1,ecdysis:id2` preserves full cluster selection across tabs

### What Worked
- Gap closure workflow caught all real issues: the initial implementation had 2 gaps (back button, o= param) that human verification found; 3 targeted fix plans resolved them cleanly
- Two-phase approach (implement → human verify → gap close → re-verify) gives high confidence without over-engineering upfront
- Plan checker identified the `_isRestoringFromHistory` async timing subtlety before execution, which helped the executor pick the right `map.once('moveend')` approach first try

### What Was Inefficient
- The `_isRestoringFromHistory` bug required gap closure despite the root cause being identified in research — the initial plan didn't fully internalize the async OL moveend timing and produced synchronous reset code
- Three separate o= bugs (strip on load, single-ID encoding, no re-push after restore) could have been caught by a more thorough initial review of `firstUpdated` and the singleclick handler
- PROJECT.md had stale content (NAV-01 listed as Out of Scope for v1.2, Current Milestone still pointing to iNat) — required manual cleanup at milestone completion

### Patterns Established
- `map.once('moveend', ...)` for deferred flag reset after programmatic OL view changes — synchronous reset is wrong, OL fires moveend asynchronously after DOM repaint
- Lit `updated()` pattern for URL-pushed restore props: BeeMap pushes 6 `@property` restore fields; BeeSidebar mirrors to `@state` via `updated()` — clean separation, no prop drilling through OL event callbacks
- Comma-separated IDs in a single URL param (`o=`) for multi-item selection — simpler than multiple params, easy to split/join

### Key Lessons
1. **OL async event timing is subtle** — `moveend`, `singleclick`, and `change` all fire asynchronously. Any guard flag reset or state push that depends on "after OL does X" must use `map.once(event, cb)`, not synchronous code after the OL method call.
2. **Human verification is a first-class plan** — having a dedicated checkpoint plan (07-02, 07-05) with explicit scenarios made gap tracking clean and gave a clear pass/fail record.
3. **URL param stripping on initial load is an easy-to-miss bug** — when implementing URL restore, verify that the first `replaceState` call preserves all incoming params, not just the ones your code "knows about" at that point in initialization.

### Cost Observations
- Model mix: 100% sonnet (executor, planner, checker, verifier all sonnet)
- Sessions: 2 working days (2026-02-25 planning start, 2026-03-09 execution)
- Notable: Single-phase milestone kept orchestrator context very lean; parallel wave 1 (07-03 + 07-04) saved ~3 min vs sequential

## Cross-Milestone Trends

### Process Evolution

| Milestone | Sessions | Phases | Key Change |
|-----------|----------|--------|------------|
| v1.0 | ~4 | 6 | Established baseline GSD workflow for this project |
| v1.1 | 2 | 1 | First use of gap closure cycle (human verify → plan gaps → re-verify) |

### Top Lessons (Verified Across Milestones)

1. Human verification at a checkpoint plan is more reliable than automated checks for browser-interactive features
2. Gap closure plans are cheaper to write and execute than getting everything right the first time — ship, verify, fix
