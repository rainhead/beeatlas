# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-29 — milestone v4.5 started)

**Core value:** Tighten learning cycles for volunteer collectors — surface existing data in ways difficult to achieve without the site; convey liveness and togetherness among participants.
**Current focus:** Milestone v4.5 — iNat Taxonomy & Species Completeness

## Current Position

Phase: 124 of 4 — Pre-Work & Contract Cleanup (ready to plan)
Plan: —
Status: Ready to plan Phase 124
Last activity: 2026-05-29 — ROADMAP.md populated with Phases 124–127

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v4.3 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Phase 123 decisions:

- Moved occurrence_synonyms.csv to data/dbt/seeds/ (deleted data/occurrence_synonyms.csv); updated OCCURRENCE_SYNONYMS_PATH in canonical_name.py — one canonical file, no duplication
- apply_synonym() kept in canonical_name.py (unit tests pass); only ingest-time callsites in checklist_pipeline and inat_obs_pipeline removed
- Both pipeline ingest functions now write raw normalize_scientific_name() output; synonym application delegated to dbt int_combined LEFT JOIN
- Per-arm LEFT JOIN (not leading CTE) in int_combined to avoid CTE scoping risk with UNION ALL
- agapostemon texanus retained as checklist-only species row (occurrence_count=0, inat_obs_count=0) per research Pitfall 5 — test corrected accordingly

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 121: Prebuilt SQLite Load — COMPLETE
- Phase 122: Worker GeoJSON Aggregation — COMPLETE

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
