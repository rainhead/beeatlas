- [x] Phase 41: CSV Export (1/1 plans) — completed 2026-04-09

**Milestone Goal:** Add a table-centric alternative to the map view so users can sort, browse, and export the filtered specimen/sample dataset.

### Phase 39: View Mode Toggle
**Goal**: Users can switch between map view and table view, with the choice bookmarkable in the URL
**Depends on**: Phase 38
**Requirements**: VIEW-01, VIEW-02, VIEW-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can click a toggle control in the main UI to switch from map view to table view and back
  2. In table view, the map is not visible and the table area occupies the full content space
  3. Navigating to a URL with `view=table` param opens directly in table view
  4. Copying a table-view URL and pasting it in a new tab restores the table view
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [x] 39-01-PLAN.md — Extend url-state.ts with viewMode field and round-trip serialization
- [x] 39-02-PLAN.md — Add view mode toggle row to bee-sidebar (view-changed event)
- [x] 39-03-PLAN.md — Wire _viewMode state into bee-atlas (conditional render, URL push, popstate restore)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 40: bee-table Component
**Goal**: Users can browse, sort, and paginate the filtered dataset as a table
**Depends on**: Phase 39
**Requirements**: TABLE-01, TABLE-02, TABLE-03, TABLE-04, TABLE-05, TABLE-06, TABLE-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Table shows specimen rows (species, collector, year, month, county, ecoregion, field number) when layer mode is "specimens", and sample rows (observer, date, specimen count, county, ecoregion) when layer mode is "samples"
  2. Applying a filter updates the table to show only rows matching the active filter — the same set visible as dots on the map
  3. A row count indicator reads "showing 1–100 of N specimens" (or samples), accurately reflecting the filtered total
  4. Previous/next page controls navigate through the result set, with current page shown; each page shows up to 100 rows
  5. Clicking a column header sorts the table by that column; clicking again reverses sort direction
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 40-01-PLAN.md — Data layer: extend UiState with sort params, add queryTablePage function and column constants
- [x] 40-02-PLAN.md — Presenter + wiring: create bee-table component, integrate into bee-atlas with state management
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 41: CSV Export
**Goal**: Users can download the full filtered result set as a CSV file with a descriptive filename
**Depends on**: Phase 40
**Requirements**: CSV-01, CSV-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Clicking "Download CSV" triggers a browser file download of the complete filtered result set (not just the current page)
  2. The downloaded filename reflects the active filter state (e.g. `specimens-bombus-2023.csv` or `samples-all.csv`)
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 41-01-PLAN.md — Add CSV export: queryAllFiltered, buildCsvFilename, Download CSV button, bee-atlas handler
**UI hint**: yes

</details>

### v2.4 Header Navigation & Toolbar (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Reorganize the UI into a header-driven layout with navigational data-layer tabs, a map/table view toggle, and a persistent filter toolbar, replacing the sidebar's navigation and filter roles.

- [x] **Phase 52: Header Component** — nav tabs for layer switching + map/table icon toggle on the right (completed 2026-04-13)
- [x] **Phase 53: Filter Toolbar** — move all filter controls and CSV download out of sidebar into persistent toolbar below header
- [ ] **Phase 54: Sidebar Cleanup** — sidebar becomes click-detail only, hidden by default, dismissible

## Phase Details

### Phase 52: Header Component
**Goal**: Users can switch data layers and views from a persistent header bar at the top of the page
**Depends on**: Phase 51
**Requirements**: HDR-01, HDR-02, HDR-03, HDR-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can click Specimens or Samples tab in the header to switch the active data layer; the active tab is visually distinct from the inactive one
  2. Species and Plants appear as greyed-out disabled tabs in the header, signaling future roadmap items without being clickable
  3. User can click icon buttons on the right side of the header to toggle between Map and Table views
  4. On narrow viewports, the nav tabs collapse to a hamburger menu that expands to show all tab options
  5. The `lm=` and `view=` URL params continue to round-trip correctly through the new header controls
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 52-01-PLAN.md — Create bee-header Lit component with nav tabs, view icons, hamburger menu, and unit tests
- [x] 52-02-PLAN.md — Wire bee-header into bee-atlas, clean up index.html, visual verification
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 53: Filter Toolbar
**Goal**: Users see all filter controls and the CSV download button in a persistent toolbar below the header, not inside the sidebar
**Depends on**: Phase 52
**Requirements**: FILT-08, FILT-09
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Taxon, year, month, county, and ecoregion filter controls are visible in a toolbar below the header when the app loads — no sidebar interaction required to reach them
  2. CSV download button appears in the filter toolbar and triggers a download of the current filtered result set
  3. Filter state (chips, URL params) continues to work identically to before — changing a filter in the toolbar updates the map and table
  4. The sidebar no longer contains filter controls or the CSV download button
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 53-01-PLAN.md — Create bee-filter-toolbar, wire into bee-atlas, clean up bee-sidebar
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 54: Sidebar Cleanup
**Goal**: The sidebar is hidden until the user clicks a map feature, and can be dismissed back to hidden
**Depends on**: Phase 53
**Requirements**: SIDE-01, SIDE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When the app loads with no map feature selected, the sidebar is not visible — the map or table occupies the full content area
  2. Clicking a specimen cluster or sample dot on the map opens the sidebar showing the relevant detail panel
  3. User can dismiss the open sidebar (via a close button or equivalent) and it returns to hidden; the map/table returns to full width
  4. The sidebar no longer contains the layer toggle, view toggle, filter controls, or feed subscription links
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 53-01-PLAN.md — Create bee-filter-toolbar, wire into bee-atlas, clean up bee-sidebar
**UI hint**: yes
